This bash script updates the dependency locks for each submodule in the activitywatch repository. Here is an explanation of what each part of the script does:

1. `set -e`: This option makes the script exit immediately if a command fails.

2. `set -x`: This option makes the script print each command before executing it.

3. The script loops through each submodule in the activitywatch repository.

4. For each submodule:
   - It navigates to the submodule directory.
   - It checks if the submodule is on the master branch. If it's not on the master branch, the script aborts.
   - It then updates dependency locks for the submodule:
     - If `poetry.lock` exists in the submodule directory, it uses `poetry update` to update the dependencies.
     - If `Cargo.toml` exists in the submodule directory, it uses `cargo update` to update the dependencies.

5. After updating the dependencies for the submodule, the script goes back to the root directory of the activitywatch repository.

Overall, this script automates the process of updating dependencies for each submodule in the activitywatch repository based on the type of dependency management tool used (either Poetry or Cargo).
