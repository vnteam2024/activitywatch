This script creates symbolic links for systemd unit files of three modules (aw-server, aw-watcher-afk, aw-watcher-x11) to run them as user services. 

The script iterates through the list of module names and creates symbolic links for their respective systemd unit files. The path for the systemd unit file is constructed using the `$(pwd)` command to get the current working directory where the script is located and appending the module name and its service file path. The symbolic link is created in the `~/.config/systemd/user/` directory with the same name as the module.

Overall, this script enables the user to easily start and manage the specified modules as systemd user services.
