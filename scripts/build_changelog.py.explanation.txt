This Python script generates a changelog for a repository and its submodules. The script parses the commit messages in the git history and organizes them into different categories such as features, fixes, and miscellaneous changes. It also generates a list of contributors by resolving their emails to GitHub usernames and fetching their Twitter handles.

Here's a breakdown of the script:

- **Command Line Arguments**: The script takes several command line arguments to specify the organization, repository, project title, commit range, output path, and other settings.

- **CommitMsg Class**: Represents a commit message and provides methods for parsing the type of change (like feature, fix, build, etc.) and formatting the message.

- **Utility Functions**: 
  - `run`: Helper function to run shell commands.
  - `pr_linkify`: Formats pull request links.
  - `commit_linkify`: Formats commit links.
  - `wrap_details`: Wraps lines into a `<details>` HTML element if the body is longer than a specified number of lines.
  - `remove_duplicates`: A function to remove the longest sequence of repeated elements in a list if the sequence is longer than a minimum length.

- **Main Functions**:
  - `summary_repo`: Recursively generates a commit summary for the main repo and its submodules.
  - `build`: Builds the final changelog including contributors, release notes, and full changelog links.

- **Contributor Handling**: The script resolves contributors by matching email addresses to GitHub usernames and querying GitHub API for additional information about contributors.

- **Output**: The script outputs the final changelog with release notes, contributors, and full changelog links.

Overall, the script is designed to automate the process of generating detailed changelogs for repositories and handling contributors efficiently.
