This script is designed to crawl through log files in a specified directory, filter out lines containing specific keywords (in this case, "ERR" or "WARN"), and display those filtered lines along with the file they are located in.

Here is an overview of the key components:

1. Filepaths Retrieval:
   - The `get_filepaths` function crawls through the specified log directory and retrieves a list of filepaths for all log files found within that directory.

2. Log Collection:
   - The `collect` function reads each log file, searches for lines containing "ERR" or "WARN" but not containing certain ignored terms, and stores these matching lines in a dictionary where the key is the filepath and the value is a list of matching lines.

3. Functions for Line Age Calculation:
   - The `line_age` function calculates the age of a line based on the date information extracted from it.

4. Main Function:
   - The `main` function is the entry point of the script. It calls the `collect` function and processes the collected log lines based on optional parameters like excluding testing lines, setting a limit on the number of days considered, and limiting the number of lines to display.

5. Script Execution:
   - The script executes the `main` function when run directly, displaying the filtered log lines along with their file locations.

Overall, this script is useful for quickly identifying and reviewing specific error or warning messages in log files based on defined criteria, providing a way to monitor and analyze log data efficiently.
