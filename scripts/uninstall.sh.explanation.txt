This script is a Bash script that uninstalls all modules related to ActivityWatcher that have been installed using pip3. 

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1. It uses the `pip3 list` command to list all packages installed using pip3.
2. It uses the `grep` command to filter out only the packages that start with 'aw-'.
3. It uses a loop to iterate over each module found in step 2.
4. For each module, it uses the `pip3 uninstall -y` command to uninstall the module without prompting the user for confirmation.

Overall, this script automates the process of uninstalling all ActivityWatcher modules that were previously installed using pip3.
