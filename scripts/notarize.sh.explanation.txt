This script is used to notarize a macOS application using Apple's notarization service. Notarization is necessary in order to distribute macOS applications outside of the Mac App Store.

1. The script defines variables for the Apple email address, password (apps-specific password), team ID, keychain profile, bundle ID, path to the application and the disk image file.

2. There are three main functions in the script:
   - `run_notarytool()`: This function uses the `xcrun notarytool` command to store credentials, submit the application for notarization, and wait for the notarization process to complete.
   - `run_altool()`: This function uses the `xcrun altool` command to store credentials, notarize the application, and wait for the notarization process to complete.
   - `run_stapler()`: This function uses the `xcrun stapler` command to staple the notarization certificate to the executable or bundle.

3. The script then checks for the availability of notarization tools (`notarytool` and `altool`) and selects the appropriate method for notarization based on the availability of the tools.

4. If the notarization method is determined, the script proceeds to zip the application (if it exists), notarize the zip file and staple the notarization certificate to the application.

5. The script also checks for the existence of the disk image file, notarizes it (if it exists), and staples the notarization certificate to the disk image.

Overall, the script automates the notarization process for a macOS application, making it easier to distribute the application outside of the Mac App Store.
