This script is used to package the ActivityWatch application as an AppImage. Here is a breakdown of what the script does:

1. It finds the latest zip file in the `./dist/` directory (which is assumed to be the built zip file) and unzips it.
2. It fetches two AppImage tools (`linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage` and `appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage`) from their respective Github repositories and makes them executable.
3. It creates an `AppRun` file which is a shell script that executes the `aw-qt` executable in the `activitywatch` directory.
4. It uses `linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage` to build the AppImage by specifying the necessary parameters such as the app directory, executable, desktop file, icon file, and icon filename.
5. The built AppImage file is then copied to the `./dist/` directory with the name `activitywatch-linux-x86_64.AppImage`.

Overall, this script automates the process of creating an AppImage for the ActivityWatch application using the specified tools and parameters.
