This script is a bash script used to package the ActivityWatch application for different platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows) and architectures (32-bit and 64-bit). 

Here's a brief overview of what the script does:

1. The `get_platform` function determines the platform (linux, macos, windows) the script is running on.
2. The `get_version` function uses the `getversion.sh` script to get the version of the application.
3. The `get_arch` function gets the architecture of the platform the script is running on.
4. It then outputs the platform, architecture, and version of the application.
5. The `build_zip` function zips the executables for the application into a zip file named based on the platform, architecture, and version.
6. The `build_setup` function builds a Windows setup installer using Inno Setup and names it based on the platform, architecture, and version.
7. If the platform is Windows, it calls the `build_setup` function after calling the `build_zip` function.
8. Finally, it lists the contents of the `dist` directory to show the packaged files.

Overall, this script is used to automate the packaging process for distributing the ActivityWatch application on different platforms and architectures.
