This script is a bash script that retrieves the version of the software from various sources. It first checks if there is a Travis CI tag (TRAVIS_TAG) or an AppVeyor tag (APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG_NAME) defined. If there is a tag in either of these environments, it sets the version to that tag.

If there is no tag defined in the CI environment, it then checks the latest tag and appends the commit ID to form a development version. This is done using `git describe --tags --abbrev=0` to get the latest tag and `git rev-parse --short HEAD` to get the short commit ID.

Finally, the script echoes the determined version.

This script is useful in CI/CD pipelines where the software version needs to be identified for deployment purposes.
