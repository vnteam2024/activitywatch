This script is used to package the ActivityWatch application into a .deb package for Debian-based systems. Here is a breakdown of what the script does:

1. It obtains the version number of the application by running the `getversion.sh` script.
2. It creates a directory with the package name using the obtained version number.
3. Installs necessary package tools like `sed`, `jdupes`, and `wget`.
4. If the package directory already exists, it removes it.
5. Creates necessary directories for the .deb package structure (DEBIAN, opt, etc.).
6. Copies the control file for the .deb package and replaces the placeholder with the actual version number.
7. Verifies the content of the control file.
8. Copies the contents of the `dist/activitywatch/` directory to the `opt` directory in the package.
9. Hard links duplicated libraries using `jdupes`.
10. Changes ownership of the package directory to root.
11. Modifies the .desktop file to point to the correct executable path.
12. Copies the .desktop file to the autostart directory and the applications directory.
13. Builds the .deb package using `dpkg-deb`.
14. Moves the generated .deb package to the `dist` directory with the proper naming.

Overall, this script automates the process of creating a .deb package for the ActivityWatch application with the correct version number and directory structure.
