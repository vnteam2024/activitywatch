This code is a Python script that serves as a watcher for keyboard and mouse input activities. It uses the ActivityWatch library to track and record user input events. Here's a breakdown of the main components and functionality of the script:

1. Imports:
   - The script imports necessary libraries such as logging, datetime, time, aw_client, and click.
   - It also imports the KeyboardListener and MouseListener classes from aw_watcher_afk.listeners module.

2. Command Line Input:
   - The script defines a command line interface using Click library, with an option "--testing" to enable testing mode.

3. Main Function:
   - The main function is defined as a Click command with the "main" decorator.
   - It initializes the ActivityWatch client, creates a bucket for input data, and starts the keyboard and mouse listeners.
   - It enters into a loop where it periodically checks for input events from the keyboard and mouse, merges the data, and creates an Event object.
   - If there is new input, it sends a heartbeat with the event data to the ActivityWatch server. If there is no input, it sends a heartbeat with all-zeroes data and a "pulsetime" parameter.
   - The script also handles sleeping between iterations to maintain a predictable polling cadence.

4. Event Data and Heartbeats:
   - The script extracts input data from both the keyboard and mouse listeners.
   - It merges the data for both input sources into a single dictionary.
   - It creates an Event object with a timestamp, duration, and merged input data.
   - If there is new input, it sends a heartbeat with the event data to the ActivityWatch server. If there is no input, a pulsetime parameter is used instead.
   - The script logs information about the input events and whether there is new input or not.

Overall, this script uses keyboard and mouse listeners to track user input events and sends heartbeat messages to the ActivityWatch server based on the input activity. It is designed to monitor user activity and record input events for analysis and tracking purposes.
