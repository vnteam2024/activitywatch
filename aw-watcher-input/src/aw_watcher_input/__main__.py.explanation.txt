This code is the entry point for the aw-watcher-input module in the ActivityWatch project. It imports the main function from the main module and then calls it when this script is executed directly.

The main function likely contains the core functionality of the aw-watcher-input module, which is responsible for monitoring user input events such as keystrokes and mouse movements.

When this script is executed, it will call the main function, which will start monitoring input events and recording them for further analysis or logging.
