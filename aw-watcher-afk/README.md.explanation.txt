This README file provides information about the aw-watcher-afk project, which is a tool that watches keyboard and mouse activity to determine if a user is AFK (away from keyboard) or not. It includes details on how to install the application, either from a pre-built package, building your own package, or installing directly from GitHub.

Key points from the README:
1. The tool flags a period of at least 3 minutes of inactivity as AFK by default.
2. Installation options include downloading the pre-built application from the ActivityWatch website, building your own package with `make package`, installing the latest version from GitHub with `pip install git+https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-afk.git`, or installing from a cloned version with `poetry install` or `pip install .`.

Overall, the README provides an overview of the aw-watcher-afk project, its purpose, and how to install it using different methods.
