This code defines a query language parser in Python for interpreting and executing queries. Here is a breakdown of the key components of the code:

1. `QToken` class and its subclasses (`QInteger`, `QVariable`, `QString`, `QFunction`, `QDict`, `QList`): These classes represent different types of tokens that can be parsed in the query language. Each subclass implements methods for parsing and interpreting the token.

2. Parsing Functions: The code contains parsing functions to tokenize and parse different types of tokens such as integers, variables, strings, functions, dictionaries, and lists.

3. Namespace and Interpretation: The code manages a namespace dictionary that stores variables and their corresponding values. It also includes functions for interpreting the parsed tokens and assigning values to variables in the namespace.

4. Query Execution: The `query` function takes a query string, parses it, and executes it using the provided datastore. The query string can contain multiple statements separated by semicolons. The result of the query is stored in the `RETURN` variable in the namespace.

5. Error Handling: The code includes error handling for syntax errors, undefined variables, and invalid function calls.

Overall, this code provides a framework for parsing and executing queries in a custom query language using Python. It demonstrates the parsing of tokens, interpreting the parsed tokens, and executing queries using a datastore.
