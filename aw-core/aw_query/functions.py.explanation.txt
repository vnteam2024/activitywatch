This code defines query functions for the ActivityWatch framework. Here are the main components of the code:

1. **Import Statements**:
    - Imports necessary modules and functions from external libraries.

2. **Function Decorators**:
    - Two decorators are defined: `q2_function` and `q2_typecheck`.
    - `q2_function` is a decorator to register query functions and adds mock arguments for Datastore and TNamespace if they are not in the function signature.
    - `q2_typecheck` is a decorator that typechecks the arguments using `_verify_variable_is_type`.

3. **Declarations**:
    - `functions` is a dictionary that stores registered query functions.

4. **Query Functions**:
    - Query functions are defined using the `q2_function` decorator.
    - These functions interact with the datastore, query events, filter, merge, sort, summarize, and perform various operations on events.

5. **Helper Functions**:
    - Helper functions like `_verify_bucket_exists` and `_verify_variable_is_type` are used for validation and verification.

6. **Explanation**:
    - The code defines a set of query functions for the ActivityWatch framework that operate on events from a datastore.
    - Functions are categorized based on their functionality such as querying events, filtering events, merging events, sorting events, summarizing events, etc.

Overall, the code provides a structured way to define, register, and execute query functions
for processing events in the ActivityWatch framework.
