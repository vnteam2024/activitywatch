This code provides functionality to reduce a list of heartbeat events by merging consecutive events together based on certain conditions. 

1. `heartbeat_reduce` function:
   - Takes a list of `Event` objects and a `pulsetime` value as input.
   - Initializes an empty list called `reduced` to store the reduced events.
   - Adds the first event from the input list to the `reduced` list.
   - Iterates through the remaining events in the input list and merges consecutive events using the `heartbeat_merge` function.
   - Returns the reduced list of events.

2. `heartbeat_merge` function:
   - Takes two `Event` objects (`last_event` and `heartbeat`) and a `pulsetime` value as input.
   - Compares the data of the last event with the data of the heartbeat event.
   - Checks if the timestamp of the heartbeat event falls within the pulsetime window after the end of the last event.
   - If the conditions are met, calculates a new duration for the merged event.
   - Updates the duration of the last event with the maximum value to avoid shortening it.
   - Returns the merged event if the conditions are met, otherwise returns None.

Overall, this code allows for the merging of consecutive heartbeat events if they have identical data and the timestamp of the heartbeat event falls within a certain time window after the end of the last event.
