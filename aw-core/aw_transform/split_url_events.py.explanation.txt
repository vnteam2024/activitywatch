This code defines a function `split_url_events` that takes a list of Event objects as input and processes each event to extract different components of the URL present in the event data. 

1. For each event in the input list, it checks if there is a "url" key in the event data.
2. If a URL is present, it uses the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module to parse the URL and extract its components like scheme, domain, path, parameters, options, and identifier.
3. It then adds these extracted components as new keys in the event data dictionary with names like "$protocol", "$domain", "$path", "$params", "$options", and "$identifier".
4. The code also includes a TODO comment suggesting that additional components like user and port could also be parsed from the URL.
5. Finally, the function returns the updated list of Event objects with the extracted URL components added to each event data.

Overall, this function is splitting the URL present in each Event object's data into its different components and adding them as new keys in the data dictionary.
