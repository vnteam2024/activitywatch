This code snippet is an `__init__.py` file for the `storages` module in the `aw_datastore` package of the ActivityWatch project. 

Here's a breakdown of what this code does:
1. It imports the `logging` module as `_logging`.
2. It creates a logger object named `logger` using `__name__` as the logger name.
3. It imports specific storage classes from the `storages` package including `AbstractStorage`, `MemoryStorage`, `PeeweeStorage`, and `SqliteStorage`.
4. It defines `__all__` list containing the names of the classes that should be imported when importing the `storages` module.

Overall, this code sets up the module for the `aw_datastore` package, making specific storage classes available for import when the `storages` module is imported.
