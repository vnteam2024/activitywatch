This code defines an abstract base class `AbstractStorage` with methods that represent storage operations for a data store. 

- The class defines abstract methods for initializing the storage, getting buckets, creating, updating, and deleting buckets, getting metadata of a bucket, getting events from a bucket, inserting events into a bucket, deleting events from a bucket, and replacing events in a bucket.
- The class also provides concrete implementations for some methods such as getting events count and inserting multiple events.
- Each method raises a `NotImplementedError`, indicating that subclasses must implement these methods.

Overall, this class serves as a blueprint for implementing different types of storage classes that interact with a data store to store and retrieve data in the context of this specific project.
