This Python code is a module from the `activitywatch` project that deals with migrating data storage from one version to another. Here is an explanation of the code:

1. The `detect_db_files` function takes `data_dir`, `datastore_name`, and `version` as input parameters and returns a list of database filenames based on the provided parameters.
2. The `check_for_migration` function checks if there is any migration needed for the specified datastore. It first gets the data directory using `get_data_dir` function and then checks if the datastore is SQLite. If it is SQLite, it looks for database files of version 2 and migrates them to version 1 using the `peewee_v2_to_sqlite_v1` function.
3. The `peewee_v2_to_sqlite_v1` function performs the migration from Peewee version 2 to SQLite version 1. It fetches buckets and events from the PeeweeStorage, creates buckets in the new database, and inserts events for each bucket.
4. In the migration process, the code logs messages using the `logger` object to inform about the progress and completion of the migration.

Overall, this code is responsible for detecting the need for migration, specifically for SQLite databases, and performing the migration from an older version of the database to a newer version.
