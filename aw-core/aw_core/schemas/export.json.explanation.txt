This code defines a JSON schema for the Export model used by ActivityWatch. 

- "$id": specifies the ID of the schema.
- "$schema": specifies the schema version being used.
- "title": specifies the title of the schema.
- "description": provides a description of the schema.
- "type": specifies that the root element of the schema is an object.
- "required": specifies any properties that are required in the object (in this case, none are required).
- "properties": defines the properties that the object can have. In this case, there is one property called "buckets" which is an array of objects.
  - "buckets": specifies an array of objects, where each object conforms to the "Bucket" schema defined elsewhere.

Overall, this JSON schema defines the structure of an "Export" object used by ActivityWatch, which contains an array of "Bucket" objects.
