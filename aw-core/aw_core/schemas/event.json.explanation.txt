This is a JSON schema definition for the "Event" model used in ActivityWatch. 

- The schema specifies that an Event object must have a "timestamp" property, which is a string in date-time format. This timestamp represents the time at which the event occurred.
- The schema also specifies that an Event can have a "duration" property, which is a number representing the duration of the event.
- The schema allows for an optional property called "data" which is an object that can contain additional information about the event.

Overall, this schema defines the structure and required properties for an Event object in the ActivityWatch system.
