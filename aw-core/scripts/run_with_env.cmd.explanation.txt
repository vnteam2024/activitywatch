This batch script is used to configure the environment variables for building Python extensions on Windows, specifically for 64-bit Python versions 2 and 3. It determines the version of Python being used (major and minor versions) and sets the appropriate Windows SDK version and configuration based on that.

Here's a breakdown of the script:
- It sets the initial variables, such as the command to run, the path to the Windows SDK root, and the path to the Windows WDK.
- It extracts the major and minor versions of the Python being used.
- It then determines the Windows SDK version to use based on the Python version and whether to set the SDK for 64-bit.
- If the Python architecture is 64-bit, it configures the Windows SDK accordingly and executes the command to run. If not, it uses the default MSVC build environment for 64-bit architecture.
- If the Python architecture is 32-bit, it uses the default MSVC build environment and executes the command to run.

Overall, the script dynamically sets up the environment for building Python extensions on Windows based on the Python version and architecture.
