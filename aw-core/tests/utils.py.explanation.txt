This Python code snippet defines utility functions and classes for testing the activity-watcher application. Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. `logging` module is imported to enable logging for debugging purposes.
2. `random`, `datetime`, and `timezone` modules are imported for generating random numbers and handling date/time values.
3. `from aw_datastore import Datastore, get_storage_methods` are imported. `Datastore` is used to interact with storage for the activity-watcher application.
4. Logging configuration is set to debug level.
5. `now` variable is assigned the current datetime in UTC timezone.
6. `TempTestBucket` class is defined as a context manager for creating a test bucket. It creates a test bucket with random ID when entering the context and deletes it when exiting the context.
7. `__repr__` method is defined to provide a string representation of the `TempTestBucket` object.
8. `_storage_methods` variable is assigned the result of calling `get_storage_methods` function, which returns available storage methods.
9. `param_datastore_objects` function returns a list of `Datastore` objects for each storage strategy available.
10. `param_testing_buckets_cm` function creates a list of `TempTestBucket` instances for each storage strategy available.

Overall, the code provides utility functions and classes for testing data storage functionality in the activity-watcher application by creating temporary test buckets and datastore objects.
