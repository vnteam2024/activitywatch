This code is a test suite for the various functions in the `aw_transform.py` file of the Activity Watch project. The functions being tested include data transformation functions like filtering, sorting, merging, categorizing, tagging, and union operations on event data.

Here is an overview of the tests being conducted:

1. `test_simplify_string()`: Tests the `simplify_string` function which simplifies strings in events data.

2. `test_filter_keyval()`: Tests the `filter_keyvals` function which filters events based on specific key values.

3. `test_filter_keyval_regex()`: Tests the `filter_keyvals_regex` function which filters events based on regular expressions of key values.

4. `test_intersecting_eventpairs()`: Tests the `_intersecting_eventpairs` function which finds intersecting event pairs.

5. `test_filter_period_intersect()`: Tests the `filter_period_intersect` function which filters events based on intersecting periods.

6. `test_period_union()`: Tests the `period_union` function which unions events based on periods.

7. `test_sort_by_timestamp()`: Tests the `sort_by_timestamp` function which sorts events based on timestamps.

8. `test_sort_by_duration()`: Tests the `sort_by_duration` function which sorts events based on durations.

9. `test_sum_durations()`: Tests the `sum_durations` function which sums the durations of events.

10. `test_merge_events_by_keys_1()` and `test_merge_events_by_keys_2()`: Tests the `merge_events_by_keys` function which merges events based on specific keys.

11. `test_chunk_events_by_key()`: Tests the `chunk_events_by_key` function which chunks events based on a specific key.

12. `test_url_parse_event()`: Tests the `split_url_events` function which parses URL events into components.

13. `test_union()`: Tests the `union` function which unions two event lists with duplicates.

14. `test_categorize()`: Tests the `categorize` function which categorizes events based on rules.

15. `test_tags()`: Tests the `tag` function which tags events based on rules.

16. `test_union_no_overlap()`: Tests the `union_no_overlap` function which unions events without overlapping.

Each test is a unit test that checks the functionality of a specific transform function in the `aw_transform.py` file. The tests ensure that the functions are working correctly and producing the expected results on the event data.
