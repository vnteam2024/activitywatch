This GitHub Actions workflow is set up to run on pushes and pull requests to the master branch. It defines a job called "build" that runs on different operating systems (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) with Python version 3.8.

The steps of the job include checking out the repository, setting up Python, installing dependencies using Poetry, building the project, running tests and type checks, and reporting coverage using Codecov.

Overall, this workflow is used to automate the build and testing process for the project on different operating systems and ensure code quality and coverage.
