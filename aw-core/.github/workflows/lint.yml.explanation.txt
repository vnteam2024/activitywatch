This is a GitHub Actions workflow file named `lint.yml` located in the `.github/workflows` directory of a repository. 

The workflow has two jobs: `lint` and `format`. 

The `lint` job runs on pushes to the `master` branch and pull requests targeting the `master` branch. It runs on the `ubuntu-latest` virtual environment. 
The steps in the `lint` job are as follows:
1. Checkout the code from the repository using `actions/checkout@v3`.
2. Setup Python using `actions/setup-python@v4`.
3. Use the `jpetrucciani/ruff-check@main` action to perform linting checks.

The `format` job also runs on the `ubuntu-latest` virtual environment. 
The steps in the `format` job are as follows:
1. Checkout the code from the repository using `actions/checkout@v3`.
2. Setup Python using `actions/setup-python@v4`.
3. Use the `psf/black@stable` action to format the code using the Black code formatter.

In summary, this workflow file sets up two jobs that run linting checks and code formatting checks respectively on the codebase when pushed to the `master` branch or when pull requests are made to the `master` branch.
