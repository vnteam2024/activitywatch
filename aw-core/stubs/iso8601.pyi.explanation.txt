This code defines a module `iso8601` containing a function `parse_date` which takes a string `x` as input and returns a `datetime` object. The function does not have a body as it is a stub function, meaning it is just a placeholder and does not actually implement the functionality. 

Additionally, the code defines a custom exception class `ParseError` which inherits from the base `Exception` class. This exception can be raised when there is an error parsing the date string in the `parse_date` function.

Overall, this code provides a starting point for implementing functionality to parse ISO 8601 formatted date strings in Python.
