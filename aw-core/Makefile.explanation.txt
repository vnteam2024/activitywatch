This Makefile is used to automate common tasks related to building, testing, benchmarking, type checking, linting, and formatting the code in the `aw-core` directory of the ActivityWatch project.

1. `build`: Installs the project dependencies using Poetry.

2. `test`: Runs tests using pytest with coverage enabled for multiple components of the project.

3. `.coverage`: Dependency for the `coverage_html` target, generated when running the `test` target.

4. `coverage_html`: Generates an HTML coverage report using the coverage tool.

5. `benchmark`: Runs the benchmarking script for the data store component.

6. `typecheck`: Runs mypy type checking with certain options and paths specified.

7. `typecheck-strict`: Runs mypy type checking with stricter options and paths specified, with a message if there are no failing steps.

8. `lint`: Runs linters such as ruff on the project files.

9. `lint-fix`: Fixes linting issues using tools like pyupgrade and ruff.

10. `format`: Formats the Python files using the black formatter.

11. `clean`: Removes build artifacts and cached files.

Overall, this Makefile helps in maintaining code quality, ensuring tests are run, and automating common development tasks in the ActivityWatch project.
