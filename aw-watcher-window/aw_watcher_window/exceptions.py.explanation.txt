This code defines a custom exception class called `FatalError` that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class. It is used to raise an exception when the program encounters a fatal error that requires it to exit. By raising this exception, the program can handle the error and exit gracefully. Custom exception classes can be useful for organizing and identifying different types of errors in a program.
