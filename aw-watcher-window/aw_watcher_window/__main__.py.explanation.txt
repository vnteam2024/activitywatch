This code is the main entry point for the aw_watcher_window module in the activity-watcher project. It imports the main function from the aw_watcher_window module and then checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module). If it is being run directly, it calls the main function, which is likely responsible for starting the window watcher functionality that monitors window focus/activity on the user's computer.
