This code provides functions to retrieve information about the active window on a Windows system. Here is a breakdown of the key components:

1. `get_app_path(hwnd)`: This function retrieves the application path of the active window given its `hwnd` (window handle). It uses the `win32process` and `win32api` modules to get the process ID associated with the window handle, then opens the process and retrieves the module file name.

2. `get_app_name(hwnd)`: This function retrieves the application filename of the active window given its `hwnd`. It calls `get_app_path()` first to get the path and then extracts the basename of the path to get the filename.

3. `get_window_title(hwnd)`: This function simply returns the title of the active window given its `hwnd`.

4. `get_active_window_handle()`: This function retrieves the handle of the foreground window, i.e., the currently active window.

5. `get_app_name_wmi(hwnd)`: This function is a fallback option that uses the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to retrieve the application filename of the active window. It queries for the process name based on the process ID.

6. `get_app_path_wmi(hwnd)`: This function is similar to `get_app_name_wmi()` but retrieves the application path using WMI.

7. The script contains a loop that continuously prints out the title, application name, and application path of the active window using the functions mentioned above.

Overall, this code allows you to monitor and retrieve information about the active window on a Windows system continuously. It uses a combination of Win32 API functions and WMI queries to gather the necessary information.
