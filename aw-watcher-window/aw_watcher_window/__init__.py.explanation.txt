This code is importing the `main` function from the `main.py` file in the same directory and then making it available for import from this package. The `__all__` attribute is used to specify which modules or functions should be imported when using the `from package import *` syntax. In this case, only the `main` function is included in the `__all__` list, meaning that only `main` will be imported when using `from aw_watcher_window import *`.
