The README.md file provides information about the aw-watcher-window application. It includes instructions on how to install the pre-built application, build your own packaged application, and install the latest git version directly from GitHub. 

It also explains how to run the application, mentioning that an Away From Computer (afk) watcher needs to be running alongside it for it to be available in the UI.

Additionally, there is a note for macOS users about enabling access to the macOS accessibility API in order to log the current window title.

The README.md file also includes a badge for the build status on Travis CI.
