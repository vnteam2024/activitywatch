This Python script sends an email with a summary report. It uses the smtplib module to send the email and the email.mime module to create the email message.

The script defines a dataclass for Recipient, which includes the name and email address of the recipient. The create_msg function creates a MIME multipart message with the given sender, receiver, subject, text, and optional HTML content.

In the main function:
1. It retrieves SMTP server configuration from environment variables (SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD).
2. Defines sender and receiver Recipient objects.
3. Reads input from stdin if read_stdin is set to True or sets a default test message.
4. Formats the text and HTML content for the email message.
5. Creates the email message using create_msg function.
6. Attempts to send the email using an SMTP connection with SSL encryption to the specified SMTP server.
7. Prints a success message if the email is sent successfully or an error message if sending fails.

The script can be run from the command line and accepts input from stdin to generate an email report. It provides a basic framework for sending emails with text and HTML content for reporting purposes.
