This is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file that specifies a workflow named "Build". This workflow is triggered on pushes to the master branch as well as pull requests targeting the master branch.

The workflow defines a single job named "build" that runs on different operating systems specified in the "os" matrix (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-11). It also uses Python version 3.9.

The steps in the job are as follows:
1. Checks out the code from the repository including submodules.
2. Sets up Python with the specified version.
3. Installs dependencies using Poetry and creates a virtual environment using venv.
4. Runs the build command.
5. Activates the virtual environment and runs tests using the "make test" and "make typecheck" commands.
6. Reports coverage using the codecov bash script. The command to run the bash script is fetched using curl.

Overall, this workflow sets up a Python environment, installs dependencies, runs tests, and reports coverage for the project on different operating systems.
