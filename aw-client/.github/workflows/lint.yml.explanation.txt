This is a GitHub Actions workflow file named "lint.yml" that defines a job called "lint". This job is triggered on pushes to the master branch as well as pull requests targeting the master branch.

The job runs on the latest version of the Ubuntu operating system. It consists of three steps:
1. "actions/checkout@v2": This step checks out the code from the repository.
2. "actions/setup-python@v2": This step sets up the Python environment.
3. "psf/black@stable": This step installs and runs the Black code formatter to lint the code.

Overall, this workflow is set up to lint the code using the Black code formatter on push events and pull requests to the master branch.
