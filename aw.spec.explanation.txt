This code is a Python script that is used to build a PyInstaller spec file for activitywatch. PyInstaller is a program that can be used to package Python programs into stand-alone executables.

In this script, the `build_analysis` function is defined to create an analysis instance for a given module. The `build_collect` function is used to build the COLLECT statements for each module.

The script then defines the analysis instances for various modules such as `aw-server`, `aw-qt`, `aw-watcher-afk`, `aw-watcher-input`, `aw-watcher-window`, and `aw-notify` using the `build_analysis` function. It also sets up the necessary binaries, datas, and hidden imports for these modules.

Finally, the script uses the MERGE function to merge the analysis instances for the different modules and then builds the COLLECT statements for each module using the `build_collect` function. It also creates a bundle for the different modules if the platform is macOS.

Overall, this script is used to define the packaging configuration for the activitywatch project using PyInstaller. It sets up the necessary analysis and collection configurations for each module and then defines a bundle for macOS.
