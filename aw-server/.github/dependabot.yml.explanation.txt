This code snippet is a configuration file for Dependabot, a tool that automatically keeps dependencies up to date in a repository. 

The code specifies the update schedule for different types of dependencies. 

- For GitHub Actions, the dependencies will be checked for updates on a monthly basis.
- For Python packages managed by pip and poetry, the dependencies will be checked for updates on a weekly basis.
- For git submodules, the versions will be checked for updates on a weekly basis as well.

This configuration file helps automate the process of keeping dependencies up to date, ensuring that the repository is using the latest versions of its dependencies.
