This Python script defines functions to detect and set the version of the ActivityWatch server. Here is an explanation of the key components of the script:

1. `detect_version_git()`, `detect_version_pkg()`, `detect_version_poetry()`: These functions try to detect the version of the ActivityWatch server using different methods:
   - `detect_version_git()`: Tries to get the exact version tag from Git history or the latest tag with a commit identifier.
   - `detect_version_pkg()`: Tries to get the version using importlib.metadata from the `aw-server` package.
   - `detect_version_poetry()`: Tries to get the version from the `pyproject.toml` file using Poetry.

2. `detect_version()`: Calls the detection functions in a specific order and returns the version detected by the first successful method. If all methods fail, it returns a default version string.

3. `assign_static_version()`: Modifies the current script by updating the `__version__` variable with the detected version. This function reads the script, updates the version, and writes the modified script back to the file.

4. The script also sets the `__version__` variable to a development version by calling `assign_static_version()` if the script is run as the main script. It also prints the detected version using different methods.

Overall, the script is designed to dynamically detect and set the version of the ActivityWatch server based on Git tags, package metadata, or Poetry configuration, providing flexibility and accuracy in versioning.
