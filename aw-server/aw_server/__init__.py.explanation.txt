This code defines a Python package `aw_server` that contains a module `__init__.py`. 

Here is a breakdown of the code:
- It imports the logging module as `_logging`.
- It creates a logger object with the name of the module (`__name__`).
- It imports the `__version__` and `main` functions from the `__about__` and `main` modules within the `aw_server` package.
- It specifies the items that should be imported when someone imports the `aw_server` package.

Overall, this `__init__.py` file sets up the initialization of the `aw_server` package, defining what should be imported and exposing those items to users who import the package.
