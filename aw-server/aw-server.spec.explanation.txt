This code is a Python script that is used to package the `aw-server` project into an executable file. 

Here is a breakdown of the key components:

1. The script imports necessary modules such as `os`, `aw_core`, and `flask_restx`.
2. It defines the paths for the `aw_core` and `flask_restx` modules.
3. It specifies the name of the executable file to be created as "aw-server".
4. It defines the list of files and directories to be included in the executable, such as static files, templates, and schemas.
5. It creates an Analysis object that specifies the files and directories to be packaged.
6. It creates a PYZ (Python Zip) object containing the pure Python modules.
7. It creates an EXE (Executable) object with the PYZ, scripts, and other options such as name, debug, strip, upx, and console.
8. It creates a COLLECT object with the EXE, binaries, zipfiles, datas, and options such as strip, upx, and name.

Overall, this script is used to package the `aw-server` project into an executable file with all the necessary dependencies and resources included.
