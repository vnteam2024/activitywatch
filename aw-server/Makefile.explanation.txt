This Makefile is used for building, installing, testing, type checking, packaging, linting, formatting, and cleaning up the ActivityWatch server (aw-server) project.

Here are the targets defined in the Makefile:

1. `build`: This target builds the aw-webui (web user interface) and installs the necessary dependencies using poetry.

2. `aw-webui`: This target builds the web user interface for the project. It checks if the `SKIP_WEBUI` variable is set to `true`, and if not, it builds the web UI using the `make` command in the `aw-webui` directory and copies the generated files to the `aw_server/static/` directory.

3. `install`: This target copies the aw-server service file to `/usr/lib/systemd/user/aw-server.service`.

4. `test`: This target runs tests for the server using `pytest`.

5. `typecheck`: This target performs type checking using `mypy` for the server files.

6. `package`: This target generates a packaged version of the server using PyInstaller.

7. `lint`: This target runs linting checks using `ruff`.

8. `lint-fix`: This target fixes linting issues using `pyupgrade` and `ruff`.

9. `format`: This target formats the code using `black`.

10. `clean`: This target cleans up build artifacts, cached files, and uninstalls the `aw_server` package.

Overall, this Makefile provides a set of commands to manage the development workflow for the ActivityWatch server project.
