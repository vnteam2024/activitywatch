The code above is the entry point for running the `aw_notify` module from the ActivityWatcher project. It imports the `main` function from the `aw_notify.main` module and then checks if the script is being run directly (using `__name__ == '__main__'`), in which case it calls the `main` function to start the application. This allows the `aw_notify` module to be run as a standalone application from the command line.
