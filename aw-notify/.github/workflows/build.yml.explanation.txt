This GitHub Actions workflow is triggered on pushes to the master branch as well as pull requests to the master branch. 

The workflow defines a job named "build" that runs on different operating systems (Ubuntu 20.04, Windows, and macOS) and with Python version 3.11. 

The steps in the job include:
1. Checking out the code repository.
2. Setting up Python with the specified version.
3. Creating a virtual environment named "venv".
4. Installing dependencies using Poetry package manager.
5. Running tests with the "make test" command.
6. Packaging the project using the "make package" command.
7. Testing the packaged executable by running `dist/aw-notify/aw-notify --help`.
8. Uploading the packaged artifact as an artifact for later use.

Overall, this workflow automates the building, testing, and packaging of the project on different operating systems whenever there is a push or pull request to the master branch.
