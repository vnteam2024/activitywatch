This code is a spec file for PyInstaller, a tool used to package Python applications into standalone executables. 

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. The `extra_pathex` variable is used to provide additional paths to binary dependencies for Windows.

2. The `Analysis` class is used to specify the Python script(s) to be analyzed, along with other settings such as binaries, data files, hidden imports, etc.

3. The `exclude_libs` variable is used to exclude certain libraries from the binaries list.

4. The `PYZ` and `EXE` classes are used to specify the Python interpreter archive and the executable file to be created, respectively.

5. The `COLLECT` class is used to collect all necessary files (binaries, zip files, data files, etc.) into a single package.

6. There is a commented-out section for building a .app bundle for macOS. This feature is mentioned as untested.

Overall, this spec file configures PyInstaller to create a standalone executable for the `aw-qt` application, handling dependencies and packaging the necessary files into a single package.
