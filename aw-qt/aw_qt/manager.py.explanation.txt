This code is a Python module that manages modules for the ActivityWatch application. Here is a high-level overview of the code:

1. The code defines a `Module` class that represents an individual module in the ActivityWatch system. Each module has attributes such as name, path, type (system or bundled), and a reference to the process running the module.

2. There is a `Manager` class that manages multiple `Module` instances. It provides functionality to start, stop, toggle, and get the status of modules. The `Manager` class also has methods to discover available modules in the system.

3. The code contains functions to discover bundled and system modules by searching specific directories and PATH locations. These functions use platform-specific logic to identify executable files and determine if they are modules.

4. The code includes a `main_test()` function that creates a `Manager` instance, starts all modules for testing purposes, waits for 2 seconds, and then stops the modules.

5. Finally, the code executes the `main_test()` function when run as a standalone script.

Overall, this code provides a framework for managing modules in the ActivityWatch application, including the ability to start, stop, and toggle modules, as well as discover available modules in the system.
