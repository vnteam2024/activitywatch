This Security Policy outlines how to report vulnerabilities in the activitywatch project. Users are encouraged to report any vulnerabilities they discover by sending a PGP encrypted email with details to `erik@bjareho.lt` (preferably using [this PGP key](https://erik.bjareholt.com/erikbjare.asc)). The email should include all relevant details about the vulnerability.

It is important to follow responsible disclosure practices and not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been resolved. The project maintainer will provide updates on the reported vulnerability and communicate the resolution process.
