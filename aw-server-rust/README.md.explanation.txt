This README file provides information about the `aw-server-rust` project, which is a reimplementation of the `aw-server` in Rust. The file includes badges for build status, coverage status, and dependency status. 

The Features missing compared to the Python implementation are mentioned, such as the API explorer (Swagger/OpenAPI). 

Instructions for how to compile the project are included: either by using `cargo build --release` or `make build`. The location of the built executable is specified.

Instructions for running the project are provided, including using `cargo run` for quick debugging. It mentions that running `cargo run` starts `aw-server-rust` in testing mode on a different port.

There is also a mention of syncing and a reference to the `README` file in the `aw-sync` subdirectory for more details.
