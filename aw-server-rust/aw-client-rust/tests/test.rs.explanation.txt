This code is a test file for the `aw-client-rust` crate, which is a client library for the ActivityWatch project. The test file contains a `test_full` test function that tests various functionalities of the `AwClient` by interacting with a locally setup test server.

Here's a breakdown of the important parts of the code:

1. The `wait_for_server` function is used to wait for the server to start by repeatedly trying to retrieve server information until successful or a timeout occurs.
2. The `setup_testserver` function sets up a test server using the `build_rocket` function from `aw_server` crate and launches it in a separate thread. It returns a `rocket::Shutdown` handler for shutting down the server.
3. The `test_full` test function creates an instance of `AwClient` and sets up a bucket for testing purposes.
4. Various operations are performed using the client such as inserting events, getting events from a bucket, deleting events, getting event count, and deleting a bucket.
5. Assertions are made to verify the functionality of the client.
6. Finally, the test function notifies the shutdown handler to shut down the test server.

This test file ensures that the `AwClient` functions as expected by testing its interactions with a test server. The test covers basic operations such as creating buckets, inserting and manipulating events, and managing buckets. By running this test, developers can verify the correctness of the `AwClient` implementation.
