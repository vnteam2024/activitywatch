This script is used to cross-compile the "aw-server" project for Android using the Rust programming language. Here is a breakdown of what the script does:

1. It first checks the current platform to determine the appropriate configuration for cross-compilation.

2. It checks if any arguments are provided when running the script. If arguments are provided, those will be used as targets (e.g., x86_64, arm64). If no arguments are provided, it defaults to building for arm64, x86_64, x86, and arm.

3. It sets up the environment variables required for cross-compiling for Android, specifically setting the location of the Android NDK.

4. It checks if the script should build in release or debug mode based on the "RELEASE" environment variable.

5. It works around a known issue related to the "libgcc" library by creating a "libgcc.a" file.

6. It loops through a list of target architectures (arm64, x86_64, x86, arm) and sets up the necessary build configurations for each target.

7. It sets the necessary environment variables for the build (e.g., AR, CC, RANLIB) based on the target architecture.

8. It sets additional Rust flags for linking the libgcc library.

9. It performs the compilation for each target architecture using Cargo.

Overall, this script automates the process of cross-compiling the "aw-server" project for Android by setting up the necessary build configurations and environment variables for each target architecture.
