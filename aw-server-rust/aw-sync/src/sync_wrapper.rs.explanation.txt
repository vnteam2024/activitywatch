This code defines functions for pulling and pushing data from/to the ActivityWatch server using the ActivityWatch client. 

1. `pull_all` function:
- This function pulls data from all remote hosts specified in the configuration file.
- It iterates over each host, calls the `pull` function for each host, and handles any errors that occur during the process.

2. `pull` function:
- This function pulls data from a specific host.
- It establishes a TCP connection to the specified host to check if the server is running.
- It then retrieves the list of databases (`.db` files) in the sync folder for the specified host.
- It filters out databases that are smaller than 50kB (possibly empty files) and chooses the largest database if multiple databases are found.
- It constructs a `SyncSpec` object with the path to the sync folder and the selected database, and then calls the `sync_run` function with `SyncMode::Pull` to synchronize data with the ActivityWatch server.

3. `push` function:
- This function pushes data to the ActivityWatch server.
- It constructs a `SyncSpec` object with the path to the sync folder for the client's hostname and the list of buckets to sync.
- It then calls the `sync_run` function with `SyncMode::Push` to push data to the ActivityWatch server.

Overall, these functions handle the synchronization of data between the local client and the ActivityWatch server using the provided client and configuration settings.
