This file contains unit tests for the `aw-sync` crate, which is responsible for syncing data between datastores in the ActivityWatch project. 

Here is a brief explanation of the important parts of the code:

1. `init_teststate`: Function that initializes a `TestState` struct containing two in-memory datastores (`ds_src` and `ds_dest`).
2. `create_bucket`: Function that creates a bucket in a given datastore with a specified ID.
3. `create_event`: Function that creates an event with a timestamp and data.
4. `create_events`: Function that creates multiple events in a given bucket in a datastore.
5. `get_all_buckets` and `get_all_buckets_map`: Functions to get all buckets from a list of datastores and convert them into a map for easy access.
6. `test_buckets_created`: Test function to check if buckets are created in both source and destination datastores.
7. `check_synced_buckets_equal_to_src`: Function to check if synced buckets in destination are equal to source buckets in terms of events.
8. `test_one_updated_event`: Test function that syncs a single event between datastores and checks if it is updated correctly.
9. `test_events`: Test function that syncs multiple events between datastores and checks if they are synced correctly.
10. `setup_test`: Function to set up the test by creating datastores, buckets, and events.

Overall, these test functions cover scenarios related to syncing buckets and events between datastores and ensure that the data is transferred correctly during synchronization.
