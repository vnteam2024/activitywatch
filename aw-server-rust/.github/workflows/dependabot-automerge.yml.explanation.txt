This GitHub Actions workflow is named "Dependabot Auto-merge" and is triggered by the completion of the "Build" workflow. It only runs if the previous workflow run was successful and the actor is the dependabot[bot] user.

The workflow has a job called "auto_merge" that runs on an ubuntu-latest runner. The job uses the ridedott/merge-me-action version 2 to automatically merge pull requests. The GITHUB_TOKEN secret is passed to the action in order to have the necessary permissions to merge pull requests.

This workflow is designed to automatically merge pull requests created by the Dependabot bot user when certain conditions are met, such as the success of a specific workflow.
