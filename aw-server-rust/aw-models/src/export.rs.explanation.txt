This code defines a struct `BucketsExport` that represents a data structure for exporting a list of buckets. Each `BucketsExport` contains a field `buckets` which is a HashMap mapping keys of type `String` to values of type `Bucket`. The `Bucket` type is not defined in the provided code snippet but it is assumed to be another struct or type that represents a specific data structure related to the buckets being exported.

Additionally, the `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema, Clone)]` attribute is used to automatically implement the `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `JsonSchema`, and `Clone` traits for the `BucketsExport` struct. This allows instances of `BucketsExport` to be serialized/deserialized from JSON, validated against JSON schemas, and cloned.
