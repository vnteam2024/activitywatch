This code is a Rust library that defines the module structure for the `aw-models` crate. It includes several modules such as `bucket`, `duration`, `event`, `info`, `query`, `timeinterval`, and `tryvec`. 

The `json_map!` macro is defined using `macro_rules!` for creating a JSON object from key-value pairs. This macro is used for testing purposes only and is conditionally compiled using `#[cfg(test)]`.

The `pub use` statements at the end of the file export specific types from the internal modules so that they can be accessed from outside the crate.

Overall, this file serves as the entry point for the `aw-models` crate and organizes the various modules that make up the functionality of the crate.
