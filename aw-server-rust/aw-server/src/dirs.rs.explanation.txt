This code defines functions to get various directories (config, data, cache, log, and database) based on the target operating system. 

- For non-Android systems, it uses the `appdirs` crate to get the user-specific directories for configuration, data, cache, and log. It also creates the necessary directories if they don't already exist using the `fs` module.
- For Android systems, it uses a static `Mutex` wrapped `PathBuf` to represent the Android data directory path. The `get_data_dir` function returns this path, and `set_android_data_dir` can be used to set a custom path for the Android data directory.
- There are separate functions for each type of directory (config, data, cache, log, and database), and they are platform-dependent.
- There is a test function `test_get_dirs` that sets a custom path for the Android data directory (if running on Android) and calls each of the directory retrieval functions to ensure they work correctly.

Overall, this code ensures that the application can retrieve the necessary directories based on the target operating system and handles directory creation appropriately. It also includes testing to verify the functionality of the directory retrieval functions.
