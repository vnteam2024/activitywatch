This is a Rust library file that defines the structure and dependencies of the `aw-server` crate. Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. The `extern crate` statements are used to import external crates that the `aw-server` crate depends on.
   - `rocket` and `rocket_cors` are web frameworks for Rust.
   - `serde` and `serde_json` are libraries for serializing and deserializing data in Rust.
   - `chrono` is a date and time handling library for Rust.
   - `appdirs` is a library for determining application directories.
   - `fern` is a logging library for Rust.
   - `toml` is a library for parsing and serializing TOML configuration files.

2. The `#[macro_use]` attribute is used for enabling macros from the specified crate.
   - `macro_use` for `rocket`, `lazy_static`, `log`, and custom macros.

3. The module declarations `pub mod macros`, `config`, `device_id`, `dirs`, `endpoints`, and `logging` are defined within the crate.
   - These modules likely contain implementations for specific functionalities of the `aw-server` crate.

4. Conditional compilation is used depending on the target operating system.
   - Configuration for `appdirs` crate is included only when not targeting Android.

5. The Android-specific module `android`, which is likely to contain platform-specific functionalities for Android.

6. External crates `aw_datastore`, `aw_models`, `aw_query`, and `aw_transform` are imported as dependencies for the `aw-server` crate.

Overall, this file sets up the necessary dependencies, modules, and configurations for the `aw-server` crate to function as intended.
