This code defines a Rocket endpoint `query` that handles POST requests to the root path ("/"). The endpoint takes in JSON data representing a query using the `Json<Query>` type. The `Query` struct is imported from `aw_models`.

Inside the `query` function, the query code is extracted from the request JSON and intervals are extracted from the `Query` struct. The function then initializes an empty vector `results` to store the query results. It then acquires a lock on the `datastore` to access the data and loops through each interval in the `timeperiods`.

For each interval, it calls the `aw_query::query` function with the query code, interval, and datastore as arguments. If the query is successful, the result is added to the `results` vector. If the query fails, an error message is logged and an internal server error response is returned.

Finally, the function returns the results of all the queries as JSON in the response.

Overall, this code defines an endpoint for executing queries on the server using Rocket, handling errors and returning the results as JSON.
