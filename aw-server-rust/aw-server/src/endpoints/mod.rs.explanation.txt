This code defines various endpoints for the activitywatch server in Rust using the Rocket web framework. Here is a summary of the main components in the code:

1. `AssetResolver` struct:
   - Responsible for resolving assets (files) to be served by the server.
   - Contains a method `resolve()` that tries to read the file from a specified path or falls back to embedded assets if not found.

2. `ServerState` struct:
   - Contains the shared state needed by the server, including a `Datastore`, `AssetResolver`, and `device_id`.
   
3. Endpoints:
   - Defines several HTTP GET endpoints for serving static files like CSS, fonts, JavaScript, etc., and also an endpoint for serving favicon.
   - Contains an endpoint for retrieving server information (hostname, version, testing status, device_id).
   
4. `build_rocket()` function:
   - Builds the Rocket instance with configurations and attaches middleware like CORS.
   - Mounts different routes for various endpoints and custom static directories.
   - Configures the server to serve the API endpoints for managing buckets, querying data, importing/exporting data, and managing settings.
   
5. `tests` module:
   - Contains unit tests for the `AssetResolver` functionality, testing the resolution of files from filesystem paths and fallback to embedded assets.

Overall, this code sets up the web server for the activitywatch service in Rust, serving static assets and providing endpoints for interacting with the data store and configuring the server.
