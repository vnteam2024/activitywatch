This code defines a Rocket endpoint function called `buckets_export` that is responsible for exporting data about buckets and events. 

- It takes a `ServerState` as a parameter, which contains the datastore.
- It initializes an empty `BucketsExport` struct, which will hold information about the exported buckets.
- It retrieves a lock on the datastore to access bucket and event data.
- It retrieves all buckets from the datastore and iterates over them.
- For each bucket, it retrieves events associated with that bucket from the datastore.
- It inserts the bucket data along with the associated events into the `BucketsExport` struct's `buckets` HashMap.
- Finally, it returns the filled `BucketsExport` struct as a response.

Overall, this function retrieves data about buckets and events from the datastore and structures it into a `BucketsExport` object to be returned as a response when the '/buckets_export' endpoint is accessed.
