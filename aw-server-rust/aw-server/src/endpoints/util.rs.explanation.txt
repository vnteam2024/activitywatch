This code defines several utility functions and structs for handling responses in Rocket web framework endpoints in the `aw-server-rust` project. Let's break down the code:

1. `HttpErrorJson` struct:
   - Represents a JSON response for HTTP errors with a status code and a message.
   - Implements the `Responder` trait to convert the struct into a Rocket response.
  
2. `BucketsExportRocket` struct:
   - Wraps around `BucketsExport` struct to provide a custom Rocket responder for exporting bucket data.
   - Implements the `Responder` trait to convert the struct into a Rocket response.

3. `impl From<DatastoreError> for HttpErrorJson`:
   - Implements conversion from `DatastoreError` enum to `HttpErrorJson` struct to handle datastore errors in responses.

4. `endpoints_get_lock!` macro:
   - Provides a macro for acquiring a lock and returning an error response if the lock acquisition fails.

Overall, this code simplifies error handling and response generation in Rocket endpoints by defining custom response structs and handling datastore errors effectively.
