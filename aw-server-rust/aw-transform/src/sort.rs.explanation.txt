This code defines two functions, `sort_by_timestamp` and `sort_by_duration`, which sort a vector of `Event` structs by timestamp and duration, respectively. 

- `sort_by_timestamp`: This function takes a mutable vector of events, sorts them by their timestamp in ascending order using the `sort_by` method, and returns the sorted vector.

- `sort_by_duration`: This function is similar to `sort_by_timestamp`, but it sorts the events by duration in descending order.

The code also includes test cases for both sorting functions using the `assert_eq` macro to compare the expected sorted vector with the actual sorted vector.

Overall, this code provides utility functions to sort events based on their timestamp and duration, and it includes tests to ensure that the sorting functions work as expected.
